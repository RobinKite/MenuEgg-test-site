                    <h3>Why use MenuEgg?</h3>
                    <p>One of the hardest obstacles a restaurant owner faces is attracting customers. Existing methods include marketing through social media platforms, providing coupons either through print media or via the web, providing birthday specials
                        to bring back customers, the list goes on and on.</p>
                    <p>The hardest part about this is actually attracting the right customers and promoting to them and not a customer that is not interested in your restaurant's type of food. Provided that most customers are constantly on their smartphones
                        means that this is the perfect avenue to get users.</p>
                    <p>That is where MenuEgg comes in. We provide a platform for owners to promote to specific users who are in a specific distance of the restaurant's location and have a keen interest in your restaurant's type of food. We will send a push
                        notification to the users device which results in over 80% click-through rate which results in a growth in customer base for you!</p>
